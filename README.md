# qsxâ€™ .dotfiles
Hi there!  These are various config files for programs I use.  You are free to
do with them whatever the ISC license permits (see LICENSE for details).  I can
however only speak for my very own stuff, there are some files not written by
me in this repo.  They are either git submodules and therefore not exactly part
of this distribution or carry their own header.

## How to install
```
cd
git clone --recursive git://github.com/qsuscs/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
./setup.zsh
```
